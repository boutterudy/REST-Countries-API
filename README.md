### What I learned

With this challenge, it was the first time that I had to set up a theme switcher. So I learned how to develop one using React Contexts and SCSS mixins.

It was also my first time using React Contexts, so I learned how to use them, here for the theme switcher and the country filters.

And finally I also practiced more styling with SCSS, which I had used very little in my projects so far.

### Useful resources

- [How to Create a Dark Mode in Sass](https://medium.com/@katiemctigue/how-to-create-a-dark-mode-in-sass-609f131a3995) - This helped me for understanding the different ways to create a theme switcher.
- [Th√®me clair et sombre en SCSS et React](https://www.zaratan.fr/next-refactor-theme-scss) - I was literally stucked because my themed mixins weren't working in my components stylesheets, so after some days of research, I found that article which explained everything I needed to know to solve that problem. That was very interesting, even if I was understanding the issue before reading it, I wasn't finding a solution for it, and this is where Denis Pasin's solution helped me a lot.
